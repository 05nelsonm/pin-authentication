An Android library that provides local PIN authentication for your application.

When your application is brought to the foreground, PinAuthentication will
check if authentication is required. If so, it will automatically launch an Activity
requiring the user to enter their PIN. A correct PIN will remove the Authentication
Activity and return to the prior Activity for which it was started from.
